WAZZUP?
=======

A simple-like-a-stick single-host docker installation of BOINC client.

========

Anything with a docker-machine and docker-compose installed.


WHY?

Because I needed to a) run me a BOINC in a tiny controlled instance
and b) excercise me a docker.

LICENSE

BSD of course.


DOCS
====

Makefile, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
